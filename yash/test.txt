The insured person can send the claim form along with invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports, duly signed by the insured person, to the branch office or head office. The assessment of claim documents will be done to ascertain the admissibility of the claim. The settlement of the claim, including its rejection, will be done within 15 days of the receipt of the last 'necessary' document. For dental treatment, it is defined as a treatment related to teeth or structures supporting teeth, including examinations, fillings, crowns, extractions, and surgery. Pre-authorisation is not explicitly mentioned for dental surgery in general but is required for Orthodontic Treatment claims for dependent children below 18 years. Therefore, for this specific scenario, pre-authorisation may not be necessary, but the standard claim process applies.",
     "The document does not specifically mention Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) as a covered treatment under modern treatment methods. However, it does mention Deep Brain Stimulation as one of the modern treatments with a limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. For ICU care, the charges are covered up to the category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less. The location of the city with over 1 million population does not have a direct impact on the expenses as per the given document context.",
     "The document does not explicitly mention the addition of an adopted child as a dependent. However, it does mention the addition of a 'New born child of the employee' and 'Newly wedded spouse of the employee' under section 12.A.i and 12.A.ii. For addition of a member, the application for cover must be accepted by the insurer, additional premium on pro-rata basis must be applied, and an endorsement confirming the addition must be issued. The insurer may refuse cover if the application is not accepted or if additional premium is not received. Endorsements, including addition of a member, are subject to assessment by the underwriter and may require additional information, documents, or premium. The addition of a 3-year-old adopted child may be considered under the 'Addition of member' clause, but the specific eligibility criteria and circumstances under which the insurer may refuse cover are not explicitly stated in the document for adopted children.",
     "For the day care cataract procedure, the claim process involves submitting the necessary documents to the TPA within 15 days of the date of discharge from the hospital for reimbursement of hospitalisation expenses. The required documents include a duly completed claim form, photo ID and age proof, health card, policy copy, KYC documents, attending medical practitioner's certificate, medical history, bills, and payment receipts. For the subsequent 5-day inpatient care due to complications, the claim process also involves submitting the necessary documents to the TPA within 15 days of discharge from the hospital for reimbursement of hospitalisation expenses. Additionally, for post-hospitalisation expenses, the claim documents should be submitted within 15 days from the completion of post-hospitalisation treatment. The company will only accept bills and medical treatment-related documents in the insured person's name. The insured person may be required to provide additional information and assistance as required by the TPA.",
     "The document does not explicitly mention the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses. However, according to the provided context, 'Maternity (Code-Excl18)' covers 'Medical treatment expenses traceable to child birth (Including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections incurred during hospitalisation)'. Since the newborn's treatment is directly related to childbirth, it can be inferred that the expenses for the newborn's intensive care might be covered under the maternity cover. The document also mentions that 'any amount payable under the policy shall be subject to the terms of coverage (including any co-pay, sub limits), exclusions, conditions and definitions contained herein.' Additionally, the 'Maximum liability of the Company under all such Claims during each Policy Year shall be the Sum Insured opted as specified in the Schedule.' Unfortunately, the document does not provide specific details on the coverage for newborns or their treatment expenses. The policy terms state that 'Pre Hospitalisation and Post Hospitalisation for 30 days & 60 days respectively are covered', but it does not explicitly mention the coverage for newborns. The room rent is '2% of SI for Normal and 4% of SI for ICU (inclusive of nursing charges)', but it is unclear if this applies to the newborn's treatment.",
     "The document defines a Psychiatrist as a medical practitioner possessing a post-graduate degree or diploma in psychiatry awarded by a university recognised by the University Grants Commission, or awarded or recognised by the National Board of Examinations and included in the First Schedule to the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, or recognised by the Medical Council of India. For claims related to mental illness, the Inpatient Hospitalisation benefit will be covered up to the limit as mentioned in the schedule for specific conditions such as Schizophrenia, Bipolar Affective Disorders, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorders, and Psychosis. A Clinical Psychologist is defined as a person having a recognised qualification in Clinical Psychology from an institution approved and recognised by the Rehabilitation Council of India, or having a Post-Graduate degree in Psychology or Clinical Psychology or Applied Psychology and a Master of Philosophy in Clinical Psychology or Medical and Social Psychology obtained after completion of a full-time course of two years which includes supervised clinical training from any University recognised by the University Grants Commission. Given this, a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist may not be sufficient for a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, as the definition of a Psychiatrist specifically refers to a medical practitioner with a post-graduate degree or diploma in psychiatry, and the document does not explicitly state that a Clinical Psychologist's certification is sufficient for claims related to psychiatric treatment.",
     "According to the document, ECG electrodes are payable, with up to 5 electrodes required for every case visiting OT or ICU, and for longer stay in ICU, may require a change and at least one set every second day is payable. Sterilized Gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not payable.",
     "The policy covers Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses incurred following an Illness or Injury up to the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance. Since the insured person developed an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge, this expense can be claimed if it is within the specified number of days and amount limit. Additionally, pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness that occurred 18 days before admission can also be claimed as per the policy. The policy states that 'We have accepted a claim for In-patient Hospitalisation under Clause III.A.1 or III.A.2 above' and 'The Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses are related to the same Illness or Injury' as conditions for claiming these expenses. The date of admission to the Hospital for the purpose of this Benefit shall be the date of the Insured Person's first admission to the Hospital in relation to the same Any One Illness.",
     "According to the document, children above 18 years will continue to be covered along with parents up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried/unemployed and dependent. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period, their coverage will terminate at the age of 27, as they no longer meet the eligibility criteria. The document does not specify a pro-rata refund of premiums in such cases, but it does state that 'If the Insured Person ceases to be a member of the group' or 'When a dependent insured person ceases to be a Dependent', their cover will end, unless otherwise agreed specifically for continuation till the end of the policy period.",
     "The reimbursement/payment of all associated medical expenses incurred at the Hospital shall be effected in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of Room Rent, as per the Proportionate Clause (Note 1). This means that if the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit, the associated expenses such as diagnostic and specialist fees will be reimbursed proportionally. However, Proportionate Deductions shall not be applied in respect of those hospitals where differential billing is not followed or for those expenses where differential billing is not adopted based on the room category.",
     "If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured is intimated about the deficiency in the documents. The insured has 10 working days from the first intimation to resubmit the required documents. If the deficiency is not met or is partially met within this timeframe, the TPA/Company will send a maximum of 3 reminders. However, the document does not explicitly outline the procedure for contesting a final rejection. It does mention that claims for Pre- and Post-Hospitalisation will be settled on a reimbursement basis on production of relevant claim papers and cash receipts within the prescribed time limit. The insured must submit the necessary documents, including a duly completed claim form, photo ID, age proof, health card, policy copy, and attending medical practitioner's certificate, among others, to the TPA within the prescribed time limit for reimbursement of claims."
     "The claim is eligible as it falls under day care treatment. According to the document, '8. Modern Treatment Methods & Advancement in Technologies: In case of an admissible claim under Clause III.A.1, expenses incurred on the following procedures (wherever medically indicated) either as in-patient or as part of day care treatment in a hospital, shall be covered.' Since the procedure required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances but now can be completed within 22 hours, it is considered a modern treatment method and thus covered under the policy.",
     "For a hospital to qualify under this policy in a town with less than 1 million population, it must have at least 10 in-patient beds. In metropolitan areas or places with a population of 1 million or more, the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds. Additionally, the hospital must have qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock, qualified medical practitioner(s) in charge round the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre of its own where surgical procedures are carried out, and maintain daily records of patients that are accessible to the insurance company's authorized personnel.",
     "To add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy, the following eligibility criteria and documentation are necessary: \n   For the new employee, they must be a newly appointed employee of the policyholder, and the application for cover must be accepted by the insurer, with additional premium on a pro-rata basis applied for the risk coverage duration, and an endorsement issued confirming the addition. \n   For the spouse, they must be the newly wedded spouse of the employee, and the same conditions as the new employee apply. \n   For the sibling, they must be the employee's sibling, unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, and up to the age of 26 years. \n   The necessary documentation includes an application for cover, payment of additional premium on a pro-rata basis, and an endorsement from the insurer confirming the addition of the new insured persons.",
     "The document does not specifically mention robotic surgery for cancer. However, it mentions robotic surgeries, including robotic-assisted surgeries, for the treatment of any disease involving the Central Nervous System, with coverage up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. For other diseases, robotic surgeries are also covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. The document does not provide distinct sub-limits for day care procedures versus inpatient hospitalization for robotic surgeries. It does mention that expenses incurred on certain procedures, including robotic surgeries, as either in-patient or part of day care treatment in a hospital, shall be covered subject to additional sub-limits indicated in the table, but the specific sub-limits are not provided in the given context.",
     "For pre-authorization, the Insured Person must provide relevant medical details to the TPA. If pre-authorization is denied, it does not mean denial of treatment or coverage. The Insured Person can still get treatment and submit claim documents to the TPA for possible reimbursement. For claims assessment, the TPA will process the claim after receiving the necessary documents, including a duly completed claim form, photo ID, age proof, health card, policy copy, and medical practitioner's certificate. The claim will be settled on a reimbursement basis, and the Insured Person must submit the claim documents within the prescribed time limit. The TPA will assess all admissible claims in a progressive order, including application of the proportionate clause and co-payments. For inpatient admission, the Insured Person must settle non-admissible expenses, expenses above specified sub-limits, co-payments, and opted deductible directly with the hospital. In case of admission in PPN hospitals, a duly filled and signed PPN declaration format must be submitted.",
     "If the Insured Person is continuously covered without any break as defined under the portability norms of the extant IRDAI (Insurance Product) Regulations 2024, then the waiting period for the specific illness, such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis, would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. This implies that the waiting period applicable for pre-existing diseases or specific conditions like knee replacement due to osteoarthritis will be adjusted based on the duration of continuous coverage the insured had before porting to this policy.",
     "The document does not explicitly mention coverage for imported medications not normally used in India. However, it does exclude expenses related to 'unproven treatments' (Code-Excl16), which are defined as treatments, procedures, or supplies that lack significant medical documentation to support their effectiveness. If the prescribed imported medication is considered an unproven treatment, it may not be covered. On the other hand, the document mentions that expenses related to hospitalization, including medicines and drugs prescribed by the treating Medical Practitioner (point F), are covered. The key factor would be whether the treatment is deemed medically necessary and proven, and if it falls under the category of expenses covered during hospitalization as per the policy schedule or certificate of insurance.",
     "In the event of death of a member of a non-employer group policy, the dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured, as specified in the policy schedule. Refund of premium shall be made on a pro-rata basis, provided that no claim is paid/outstanding in respect of that Insured Person or his/her Dependents.",
     "For claims involving implanted devices, such as cardiac stents, the requirement for supporting documentation includes the original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries (i.x). Specifically, for Angioplasty Surgery, a stent invoice and sticker are required. If only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided, the claim may not be fully settled as the documentation does not meet the specified requirements, potentially leading to delays or rejection of the claim.",
     "The home nursing charges would qualify for reimbursement under the Home Nursing Charges Cover, which covers bills from a registered nursing service provider. The documentation needed includes prescriptions of the treating Specialist for support items and the original invoice of actual Medical Expenses incurred. Additionally, the medical expenses must be for the same condition for which the Insured Person's Hospitalisation was required, and the In-patient Hospitalisation claim for such Hospitalisation must be admissible by the Insurance Company. A Qualified Nurse, who holds a valid registration from the Nursing Council of India or the Nursing Council of any state in India, must provide the nursing services.",
     "In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer shall seek the details of other available policies of the policyholder and shall coordinate with other Insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount as per the policy conditions, provided a written request for the same has been submitted by the Insured Person.",
     "No, these expenses are not claimable. According to the document, expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded (B.Standard Permanent Exclusions 4.Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04)). This exclusion includes any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment (B.Standard Permanent Exclusions 4.Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04) ii). Since the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment, these expenses fall under the exclusion for diagnostic expenses not related to the current diagnosis and treatment.",
     "In the event of death of the policyholder, the Company will pay the nominee (as named in the Policy Schedule/Policy Certificate/Endorsement, if any) and in case there is no subsisting nominee, to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder whose discharge shall be treated as full and final discharge of its liability under the policy. For any change of nomination, including updating the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee, it shall be communicated to the Company in writing and such change shall be effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made.",
     "Prostheses, corrective devices, and/or Medical Appliances are not covered in the following scenarios: \n   1. They are not required intra-operatively for the Illness/Injury for which the Insured Person was Hospitalised (as stated in point 19).\n   2. Instrument used in Treatment of Sleep Apnea Syndrome (C.P.A.P.) (point 21.a).\n   3. Oxygen Concentrator for Bronchial Asthmatic condition (point 21.b).\n   4. Infusion pump or any other external devices used during or after Treatment (point 21.c).\n   5. Ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer/thermometer, and any medical equipment that is subsequently used at home, except when they form part of room expenses (point 23).",
     "The document does not explicitly mention AYUSH hospitals or their registration status as a criterion for reimbursement. However, according to the document, expenses incurred towards treatment in any hospital or by any Medical Practitioner specifically excluded by the Insurer and disclosed on its website/notified to the policyholders are not admissible (Excluded Providers - Code Excl11). Since the document does not provide information on whether the AYUSH hospital in question is excluded by the Insurer, we cannot definitively say whether expenses will be reimbursed. Additionally, the document mentions that for non-network hospitals, payment must be made up-front, and claims will be settled on a reimbursement basis on production of relevant claim papers and cash receipts within the prescribed time limit (Procedure for reimbursement of claims - 4.a.i.1).",
     "In the event of any change in the diagnosis, plan of Treatment, cost of Treatment during Hospitalisation to the Insured Person, the Network Provider shall obtain a fresh authorization letter from Us in accordance with the process described under clause V.4 above.",
     "The Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after decision of the main Hospitalisation claim.",
     "The policyholder's contact details are not explicitly mentioned in the document. However, the contact details of the agent and the insurance company are provided.

For any information, service requests, and grievances, please write to 110600@uiic.co.in.",
     "Claims cannot be approved automatically. According to the document, any deficiency in the documents shall be intimated to the Insured Person/Network Provider, and if the deficiency is not met or is partially met in 10 working days of the first intimation, the TPA will send a maximum of 3 (three) reminders. Additionally, the TPA may, at their sole discretion, decide to deduct the amount of claim for which deficiency is intimated to the Insured Person and settle the claim if they observe that such a claim is otherwise valid under the Policy.",
     "The policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the Company in the event of misrepresentation, misdescription or non-disclosure of any material fact by the policyholder.",
     "No, you cannot receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization, as per Clause 23 of the document, which states that all non-medical expenses including convenience items for personal comfort not consistent with or incidental to the diagnosis and Treatment of the Illness/Injury for which the Insured Person was Hospitalised are not payable.",
     "Sorry, I encountered an error processing this question with Groq.",
     "The document does not provide information on how to submit fraudulent claims successfully. Instead, it defines fraud and outlines the consequences of making fraudulent claims, including the repayment of amounts already paid and the forfeiture of policy benefits. According to the document, 'fraud' means any act committed with intent to deceive the Insurer, including: \n   i. suggesting something not true and not believed to be true, \n   ii. actively concealing a fact with knowledge or belief of the fact, \n   iii. any act fitted to deceive, and \n   iv. any act or omission declared to be fraudulent by law. \n   The document emphasizes the importance of truthful claims and the severe consequences of fraudulent activities."
